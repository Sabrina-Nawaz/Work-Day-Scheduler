## Description

A calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of a normal business day from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 

## Usage

The calendar populates on the web page with the current day shown at the top. The user can scroll down and select a time block for the standard business hours and enter an event which will either be color-coded as the "past" (grey), "present" (red) or future (green). Once the event is entered, it is saved and stays saved even once the page refreshes.
